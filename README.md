# radcal
A library of subroutines for calculating radiative properties of gaseous species and smoke.

RADCAL computes the spectral properties of the radiation participating species at discrete values of the spectrum (expressed either in wavenumber or in wavelength) and temperature, and returns two alternative mean absorption coefficients for each spectral band. The first coefficient is the Planck mean coefficient.  The second coefficient is the so-called path mean or effective absorption coefficient.

* RADCAL was originally developed by William Grosshandler at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Recent improvements to include additional species were implemented by Vivien Lecoustre at the University of Maryland, College Park.
